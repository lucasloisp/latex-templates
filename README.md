# ✍️ Latex Writing Templates

A `baseline` class for writing documents and creating slides for the
professional and academic context.

The template is well-suited for documents that make use of svg figures, UML
diagrams, and code samples, with otherwise minimal styling following the
guidelines of good typographic design.

## How to use this template

The `article.tex` and `slides.tex` files serve as good examples on the use of
this class.  The class itself offers a few options to customize the output, but
is otherwise quite opinionated.

The provided `Makefile` offers a pipeline for building the relevant documents,
including the use of UML diagrams created using
[plantuml](https://plantuml.com/)

# ✍️ Latex Writing Templates

These are the files I have used as a base for all of my work in University, as
well as professionaly.
The templates are well suited for work that makes use of svg diagrams, code
snippets, and light styling. 

## Features

## How to use it

The `.tex` files seen on the root of this repo are the different bases that
can be used.
`ucu-report.tex` and `ucu-brief.tex` are the two _writing_ base templates, both
oriented towards schoolwork at [my University](https://ucu.edu.uy).

In both of them you will see the space to fill in a few details:

- `\title{<++>}`, is the title of the document.
- `\newcommand{\thecurso}{<++>}`, is the course for which you are submitting
  this document.
- `\author{<++>}`, is the author or authors of the document.
- `\date{\today}`, should be the date of submission.

To use the template simply copy over the files to a new folder.

- [ ] TODO: Describe what the different files mean, as you do not need to copy
  all of them over.

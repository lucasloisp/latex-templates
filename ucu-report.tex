\section{Emoji Support 🙌}

Hello, 🌎. 🚀🌝.

\section{Syntax Highlighting with Pygments}

This allows the description of types like \mintinline{c}{int} or function calls
like \mintinline{python}{print(x**2)}.
We also allow code blocks, as follows, or even floating listings
(\ref{l:python-hello-world}).

\begin{minted}{c}
int main() {
    printf("hello, world");
    return 0;
}
\end{minted}

\blindtext

\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{python}
def main():
    print("hello, world")
    return 0
\end{minted}
\caption{We can have code as floats, Python in this case.}
\label{l:python-hello-world}
\end{listing}
